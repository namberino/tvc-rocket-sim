# Simple TVC Rocket Simulation

This is a simulation for a simple TVC model rocket with 3 degrees of freedom and a simple thrust curve.

# How it works

I've explained in details how this simulation works in [this blog post](https://namberino.github.io/posts/2024/06/modeling-a-thrust-vector-control-rocket-in-python/).

# Fluid simulation (WIP)

This is a fluid simulation made with the Lattice Boltzmann method. Still a work in progress.

Currently can simulate fluid flow on a cylinder.
